This project is a chemical inventory system suitable for multi-lab facility institutions. Users will specify in what facility they are affiliated and only the chemical inventory of that facility will they be able to access in the web app. It tracks chemical usage and can download excel file for a chemical's transaction history. The technologies used are MySQL, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS, CSS, HTML & MUI package.

To replicate the project, you have to create your own database schema using MySQL. A folder named "mysql_tables" is inside the "backend" folder which contains SQL syntaxes to create the empty tables used in this project. You can import and run it to your MySQL database schema.
